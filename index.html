				And everyday, I roamed around with this bright cheerful smile.<br/>
				Everyday, I tried to make a difference in someone's life.<br/>
				Everyday, I drowned myself in the commotion of the mind<br/>
				Everyday, I hid my wounds so that I would be their kind.<br/>
				Everyday, I sang songs to tell people that I'm perfectly fine<br/>
				Everyday, I was scared of insanity, I was scared to cross the line,<br/>
				Everyday, I improved and became a much better actor.<br/>
				Everyday, my loud cries could be heard even in Jupiter.<br/>
				But everyday, they went unnoticed.<br/>
				They were pushed aside.<br/>
				I was told that I had to be strong.<br/>
				That I've been good at maintaining the silence since so long.<br/>
				That it's all going to be alright and I just have to hold on.<br/>
				I'm sorry I hid things because everyday when I looked for someone to hold my hand they were gone.<br/>
				So tonight, Hug me close and let me be, <br/>
				Tell me that you'll always be there for me.<br/>
				Don't make promises you can't keep,<br/>
				But just stay the night and let me weep.<br/>
				For tomorrow, will be like everyday, <br/>
				And again, I will have nothing to say.<br/>

				Well I may sound mainstream but you still have to go on with your life.<br/>
				No I am not here to inspire you or tell you to build your life , find a hobby , work on you , etc.<br/>
				I'm just asking you to breathe. I'm asking you to stare at the wall with wide open eyes.<br/> 
				I'm asking you to go with the flow. Heal yourself the way you want to be healed,  you don't always have to go out and own it.<br/>
				Dont make efforts.Let life take you where it wants you to be.<br/>
				Don't get out of that bed, don't stop reading takes of love,  don't stop watching romantic movies just because someone left you.<br/>
				Don't stop crying, oh, please never stop crying.<br/>
				Cry your lungs out. Listen to their favourite songs and cry. Wear her t-shirt and then cry.<br/>
				And talk to someone, talk about their beauty of their smile and eyes.<br/>
				Talk about how much they have hurt you and you still want them. Be vulnerable.<br/>
				And one day you will get tired of the monotony. You would want life to be in a certain way,  you would want to dress up,  eat , drink, dance, smile, laugh , meet new people and just be happy.<br/>
				The pain would last but you will learn to live with it.<br/>
				Yes, that day might come after days or after years but it will surely,  will.<br/>
				And in that one day life will fix you , I promise.<br/> 
				And I hope that this day I bring to you .<br/>

				Thank you for being a true friend.<br/>
				For sticking by me, for letting me sob into your shoulder, for allowing me to play that same old tiresome record you’ve heard a trillion times before.<br/>

				Thank you for loving me when no one else would.<br/>
				Thank you for staying constant in a world full of change and chaos.<br/>

				We have climbed each other's highest peaks, and travelled through the darkest of valleys...<br/>
				With you by my side the world is a better place.<br/>
				The sun shines a little bit brighter, my smile grows a little bit wider, and in that moment, my problems are no more.<br/>
				You are the most beautiful person, inside and out.<br/>
				You are selfless, compassionate and wise beyond your years.<br/>
				I truly believe I hit friendship gold when you skipped into my life and filled my days with laughter, happy tears and enchantment...<br/>
				You have not only been my rock, my anchor, my tear catching shoulder to cry upon, but you have also taught me many things in life..<br/>
				You taught me that friends never judge each other no matter what..You taught me to forgive..<br/>
				Thank you for being my partner-in-crime, my drinking buddy, my road trippin’ companion, my telepathic pal, my personal life coach, my dancing partner and so much more...<br/>
				Thank you for all the glorious memories, wrapped up in a bow of nostalgia, so beautiful it brings a tear to my eye...
				I promise we will still be the best of friends..!! ❤❤

				This will sound strange, but sometimes I know what a person is like from the way he/she talks, walks and behaves.<br/>
				It will tell me there personality at least the basic one and then I will know who to avoid or not.<br/>

			<h3 align="center">THE DEMONS OF THYSELF</h3>
			<p align="center">
				We stopped looking for monsters under our bed when we realised they are within us.<br/>
				Often taken lightly and pushed aside for too long, they can take over.<br/>
				I am not talking about mythical demons I am talking about demons like Anger, Lust, Pain, Thirst for revenge etc.<br/>
				If they are not quelled you may as well burst like a baloon being overinflated.<br/>
				For me they are two demons Anger and Lust. Far too long I have been keeping them inside. Far too long.<br/>
				And now they are rearing to get out and I am afraid one day they will take control.<br/>
				I don't want to harm anyone or do anything wrong.<br/>
				So I search for methods to get them out I search myself, I search others.<br/>
				Till now I have been searching alone, but now I have my best friend.<br/>
				We both will search together and defeat these demons, I have to be both cooperative and patient.<br/>
				These demons will resist the efforts made by me and my best friend. But we will overcome. <br/>
				Some time, some day I will be free of them. And unto this hope I hold.

			<h3 align="center">FORSAKEN BY GOD HIMSELF</h3>
			<p align="center">
				I care a lot about many people,
				But somehow down the line I end up pushed aside,<br/>
				Due to one reason or the other,<br/>
				I say I understand and I do,<br/>
				But it tearn me up from inside,<br/>
				Trying to keep smiling and caring,<br/>
				They say one day you will find that person,<br/>
				Who cares unconditionally,<br/>
				And many times I have thought I have found the one,<br/>
				But they have their own problems of who I care for first,<br/>
				Is that a flaw? Something wrong with me?<br/>
				In this rat race I wish to see who I care for happy,<br/>
				And in return I want care nothing else<br/>
				People share their memories,<br/>
				Listening to them I want to make some of my own,<br/>
				I go to those who I am close to,<br/>
				But again I tend to get pushed aside for reasons.<br/>
				Am I that insignificant? That ignorable?<br/>
				Maybe yes because my care has always landed me in this position.
